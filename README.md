# Productivity-Scripts-Autohotkey-Windows
Autohotkey scripts to make you more productive when using Windows.

## "keyboard_as_mouse.ahk" script
Working with touchpad of laptop is not quite productive as only one hand is used for both moving cursor and clicking left and right button.  
This script replaces 'Win' key as mouse left click and 'Alt' key as mouse right click for better productivity.
