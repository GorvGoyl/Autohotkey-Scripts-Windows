BatteryDeley version 1.4 (03/30/2011)

Alerts you when your laptop battery is getting low. Also
alerts you when external power is unplugged or plugged back
in. Fully configurable.

I got tired of having my Vista laptop die on me with no
warning, so I pieced this together from various parts made by
others.

By default it alerts you when your battery gets down to
90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, and 5%. It
also alerts you when your computer becomes fully charged.
You can change these numbers to anything you like, and you
may add an unlimited number of alerts.

Each alert may include its own image, sound, or other command
to run. See file BatteryDeley.ini for settings (if there is
no BatteryDeley.ini file, run the program and it will make
one). Edit BatteryDeley.ini to change the settings.

New to version 1.1:
  Alerts when battery becomes fully charged.
  Displays battery charge percentage in pop-up when hovering mouse over tray icon

New to version 1.2:
  Minor bugfix

New to version 1.3:
  Changed default percents to 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, and 5%

New to version 1.4:
  Added ability to specify charging notifications at any percent you like
  instead of just notifying you only when charge reaches 100%. e.g. Now you
  can set it to notify you when computer is charged to 90%.
